# Specifications

This directory contains feature specifications following the spec-driven development methodology.

## Structure

Each feature has its own subdirectory containing:
- **requirements.md**: User stories and acceptance criteria (EARS format)
- **design.md**: Detailed design with correctness properties
- **tasks.md**: Implementation task list

## Workflow

1. **Requirements**: Define what the feature should do
2. **Design**: Plan how it will work, including correctness properties
3. **Tasks**: Break down implementation into actionable steps
4. **Execute**: Implement tasks one at a time

## Getting Started

To create a new feature spec, ask Kiro to help you develop requirements for your feature idea. Kiro will guide you through the requirements → design → tasks workflow.

To execute tasks from an existing spec, open the tasks.md file and click "Start task" next to any task item.
